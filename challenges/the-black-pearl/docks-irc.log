<murtogg-marine> this dock is off-limits to civilians
<captain-jack-sparrow> sorry, I didn't know
<captain-jack-sparrow> some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? you two weren't invited?
<murtogg-marine> no ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians
<captain-jack-sparrow> this must be some important boat
<marine-mullroy> ship
<captain-jack-sparrow> ship
<murtogg-marine> captain-norrington's made it his flagship. he'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the spanish lake
<marine-mullroy> commodore
<murtogg-marine> right. commodore-norrington
<captain-jack-sparrow> that's a fine goal, I'm sure ... but it seems to me a ship like that makes this one here just a wee superflous
<murtogg-marine> oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed
<captain-jack-sparrow> that so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
<marine-mullroy> there's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor
<murtogg-marine> the Black Pearl is a real ship
<marine-mullroy> no, it's not
<murtogg-marine> yes it is. I've seen it
<marine-mullroy> you've seen it?
<murtogg-marine> yes
<marine-mullroy> you've seen the Black Pearl?
<murtogg-marine> yes
<marine-mullroy> you haven't seen it
<murtogg-marine> yes, I have
<marine-mullroy> you've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
<murtogg-marine> ... no
<marine-mullroy> no
<murtogg-marine> but I've seen a ship with black sails
<marine-mullroy> oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl. is that what you're saying?
<murtogg-marine> ... no
<marine-mullroy> like I said, there's no real ship as can match
<marine-mullroy> hey!
<marine-mullroy> you!
<marine-mullroy> get away from there! you don't have permission to be aboard there!
<captain-jack-sparrow> I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty boat. ship
<murtogg-marine> what's your name?
=== captain-jack-sparrow is now known as smith
<smith> smith
<marine-mullroy> what's your business in Port Royal, 'mr. smith'?
<murtogg-marine> and no cryptic!
<smith> none? very well. you rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating
<murtogg-marine> I said, no cryptic
<marine-mullroy> I think he's telling the vera
<murtogg-marine> he's not telling the vera
<marine-mullroy> he may be
<murtogg-marine> if he were telling vera he wouldn't have told us
<smith> unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the vera if he told you it
